            I have 15 years of experience designing products anywhere from
            napkin sketch to global scale. With a background in environmental
            engineering and design, Iâ€™ve designed for complex enterprise
            applications, cloud platforms, data analytics, AI/ML, and developer
            tools; co-founded a startup; and now work on Google Search.

            I believe the best systems are as intuitive as nature, and sometimes
            just as delightfully unexpected.
